# Expense Manager Mobile Application

This project stems from the http://masteringmean.com site. I've forked an already forked angular-seed project and followed along with the tutorial at https://masteringmean.com/lessons/434?li=1.



# angular-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

The seed contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together.
